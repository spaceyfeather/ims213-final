snd_step = sound of a dog walking, Ocarina of Time (N64)



new things done, a basic summary:
-moving player between rooms
---learned that room creation code exists
-interactive dialogue box(es)
-player animations
-objects referencing the ones they're closest to
-checking distance from objects
-viewport/camera (which was awesome for me because the sprites are so small)
