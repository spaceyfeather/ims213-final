etc
new things done, a basic summary:
-moving player between rooms
---learned that room creation code exists
-interactive dialogue box(es)
-player animations
-objects referencing the ones they're closest to
-checking distance from objects
-viewport/camera (which was awesome for me because the sprites are so small)
-more with sounds

things i wanted to do but no time or energy:
-have player plant the flowers
-better transitions between rooms/start-end screens
-more stuff to do
-a reason as to why the end is so vague
-consistent aesthetics

other:
-aki (player) and score's pronouns are they/them, just like me. :)
